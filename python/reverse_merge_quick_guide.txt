REVERSE MERGE - QUICK GUIDE
================================================================================

WHAT IT DOES:
Keep ALL 695,625 operational records, add earthquake flags when they occur

RESULT:
-------
Original:  695,625 operational records (every 5 minutes for 6.8 years)
           +
           378 seismic events
           ↓
Result:    695,625 rows with earthquake flags
           - 681 records had earthquakes (0.1%)
           - 694,944 records had NO earthquakes (99.9%)

FILES CREATED:
--------------
1. operational_during_earthquakes.csv (681 rows)
   → Only records when earthquakes happened

2. daily_operations_with_earthquake_count.csv (2,448 days) ★ RECOMMENDED
   → Daily summary with earthquake counts + avg operational metrics

3. operational_with_earthquakes_full.csv (695,625 rows - optional)
   → Complete dataset with all records

WHEN TO USE:
------------
✓ Operational safety monitoring
✓ Predict if operations will cause earthquakes
✓ Compare earthquake days vs normal days
✓ Time series analysis with full history

COMPARISON:
-----------
Forward Merge:  378 rows  → Study earthquakes
Reverse Merge:  695,625 rows → Monitor operations
Daily Summary:  2,448 rows → Best for most analyses ★

RECOMMENDED:
Use daily_operations_with_earthquake_count.csv for trend analysis!

KEY INSIGHT:
Earthquakes happened during only 0.1% of operational time.
Most operations run safely without seismic events.
